# Fuck the YouTube homepage, seriously.
Can't stand the 'innovative' YouTube homepage? Good, me neither.

## What is this?
It's a chrome extension that changes the default YouTube page to your subscriptions feed.
As someone that has worked in online marketing, I understand YouTube's decision to change the homepage to a shit inducing clickbait fest.
Why would they do that, you may ask? Plain and simple. It's all about the conversions. From a business perspective it's great, but from a user perspective it's ruining the website.
If you ask me, quality goes before quantity. And that's why I've made this extension. 

## Installation
Clone the repository in a directory of choice, in Google Chrome go to: *Settings -> Extensions*, make sure the *Developer mode* checkbox is checked, click *Load unpacked extension*, navigate to 
the location you cloned the source code in and select the *src* folder and press *Ok*. That's it! Now refresh your YouTube homepage and you're set!

## Why haven't you put it up on the Chrome store?
Releasing an extension costs an initial 5 dollars (that's two days worth of food okay), the life of a student is a life of crippling debt.
If the demand relly is so big; start a gofundme campagin so we can put our collective efforts towards making this dream a reality.
